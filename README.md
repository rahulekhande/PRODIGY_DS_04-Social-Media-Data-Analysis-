# Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship  
## Task 04: Social Media Engagement Analysis  


## Overview  

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing social media engagement patterns to understand platform performance and audience interaction.

Using data analysis and visualization techniques, the project explores platform distribution, average likes, total engagement metrics, and interaction trends across different social media platforms.


## Dataset  

The dataset used for this task contains social media post data with the following columns:

- Date  
- Platform (Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, etc.)  
- Post Type  
- Likes  
- Shares  
- Comments  
- Views  

The dataset was analyzed to understand how engagement varies across platforms.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used  

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas (Data manipulation)  
- Matplotlib (Data visualization)  

## Analysis & Visualizations Performed  

### Dataset Exploration  

- Loaded dataset using Pandas  
- Checked data types and missing values  
- Previewed dataset structure  

### Platform Distribution Analysis  

- Created bar chart showing number of posts per platform  
- Identified which platform has the highest activity  

### Average Likes Analysis  

- Calculated average likes per platform  
- Compared audience engagement levels  

### Total Engagement Calculation  

- Created a new feature:
  
  Total Engagement = Likes + Shares + Comments  

- Visualized average total engagement per platform  

This helps measure overall audience interaction.

## Key Insights  

- Some platforms generate higher engagement compared to others.  
- Average likes indicate audience interest levels.  
- Total engagement provides a better understanding of interaction trends.  
- Visualization makes pattern detection easier and clearer.  

## ✅ Conclusion  

This project demonstrates how data visualization and analysis can be used to evaluate social media engagement performance.
By analyzing likes, shares, and comments, we can identify which platforms are more effective in generating audience interaction.
